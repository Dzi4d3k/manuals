## Q: I pay much less for machinery upkeep now. Why is that?
A: The machinery upkeep system has been changed and is now based on real data for the operating costs of agricultural machinery. By using this mod you will pay a low daily interest and tax as basis for the machinery upkeep. In addition you will be required to do maintenance twice a year or every 30 engine hours for any motorised machinery to avoid an increase in machinery upkeep. 

## Q: It says that I need to maintain my vehicle. How do I do that? 
A: The maintenance can either be done at the dealer or at the placeable workshop. It is more costly to conduct maintenance at the dealer than at your own workshop. It is more costly to maintain machinery that has been used much or that is older. But unused machinery has a low maintenance cost. In case maintenance is overdue, both upkeep and the maintenance cost will be higher. The longer you wait the more costly it will be. 

## Q: Why does my tractor break down?
A: Motorised machinery with overdue maintenance might break down. The longer you wait the higher the chance is that you will experience breakdowns. To avoid breakdowns you should do maintenance in due time. There is no need to manually maintain equipment that is not motorised (i.e. not with specialization <motorized>) as this is done automatically. 

## Q: I see the sell price of the machinery is different than it used to be. How is the sell price determined?
A: The sell price of the machinery is revised in the mod and based on actual data for depreciation of value of agricultural machinery. The model has been benchmarked towards advertised machinery. Note that machinery requiring maintenance will have lower sell value. Operating hours are now more important for the sell price than the age of the machinery. 


### Maintenance
- Age in maintenance GUI is now days since last repair
- New maintenance algorithm with repair, maintenance and taxes
- Keep your machine clean to lower daily maintenance costs
- Machine not used? Pay less
- You can repair your vehicles at the vehicle workshop (placeable or on the map). It is more expensive at the dealer
- If you don't maintain your vehicle, starting of the vehicle takes longer, and after a while it may not start at all
  - Currently there is no way to fix a completely broken vehicle: you can't drive it to a shop and resetting won't un-break it

When snow falls, tippers and shovels fill up. Put them in a shed (when the map has a snow mask) or activate the cover.
