Seasons Mod (title for ingame help menu)

Intro (?) (Note: maybe add a picture of the Realismus Modding logo and/or the Seasons Mod logo)
    Seasons Mod is a realism mod that adjusts nearly all aspects of Farming Simulator to more realistic parameters. Everything from seasonal effects to crop growth patterns to animal production has been changed to a more realistic level, and yes even snow has been added.
		The game year has been broken up into 4 seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Each season is broken into 3 parts equivalent to 1 month each: early, mid, and late.
		Your activities are now tied to the time of year they take place in real life.

Seasonal Effects (1) (Note: maybe add some pictures of the seasons)
    Weather is random from day to day, but follows a pattern from year to year. 
		Spring will be rainy and foggy, with some chances of sunny weather. Summer will be warmer and drier. Hail storms can occur without any warning. Autumn will be rainy with some sunny weather. Winter will be rainy, but often cold enough to allow snow to fall, maybe even stick.
		Snow will fill tippers and shovels, unless the tipper or shovel is covered in a shed with a snow mask or a tarp. Snow will also reduce traction, thus makingg vehicles slower.
		
Seasonal Effects (2)(?)
		Daylight effects are also affected with the seasons. Winters have shorter days (8 hours) while summers will have longer days (17 hours).
		Bunker silos and silage bales now require time to ferment. It takes one third of a seasons (1 game month) to fully ferment either a bunker silo or a silage bale.
		Seasons will also affect trees and foliage. The trees and bushes will change state according to seasonal temperature changes. Leaves will turn color and drop in the autumn, trees will be bare in winter, and trees will be lighter green in the spring. (note: maybe add a picture of foilage in spring, summer, fall, and winter)

Weather Forecast
		The weather forecast has been reintroduced with the Seasons Mod. The weather forecast is activated by Left Alt + F. (note: maybe add a picture of the forecast here)
		The weather forecast will show the high/low temperatures and the weather (sunny, foggy, rainy, snowy, cloudy) for the next 7 days. Summer hailstorms will not appear on the weather forecast, as hail in real life is often an unexpected event.

Soil
		Soil temperature is now properly modelled using thermodynamic equations and historical data. This means the soil will freeze in the winter when the air temperature drops below a certain point for a certain length of time. The soil will then thaw in the spring when the air temperature rises above a certain for a certain of lenght of time.
		While the ground is frozen, the soil will not be able to worked. Crops will not grow in frozen soil.
		Crops will only germinate when the soil temparature is above their germination temperatures. The germinations temperatures are included on the first page of the Seasons Mod settings menu (Left Alt + S).

Crops - Intro (1)
		When starting a new game all crops will be reset to their harvested stages to simulate the fact the fields have not been worked since the autumn. When using the Seasons mod for the first time in an existing savegame, you will have the option to either reset the crops or not.
		The default growth patterns of crops have been replaced with the Seasons Mod. Crops will now follow a realistic growth pattern following their corresponding seasonal planting and harvesting times. This also means that the winter will kill most crops, and crops planted at the wrong time will not grow.
		
Crops - Intro (2)
		Crops are now only harvestable in their final growth stage, except for poplar, oilseed radish, potatoes, and sugar beets. Crops will stay in this final stage until it is killed off in the winter.
		Silage from whole-crop or corn can still be harvested in its final green state.
		
Crops - Arable Crops
		Crop growth is now much longer. It may take a half a year for a crop to reach a certain 
		While the winter will kill most crops, winter and spring crops are possible. Wheat, barley, poplar, grass, oilseed radishes, and canola can be planted in the autumn for winter crops or planted in the spring for spring crops. Be certain that the soil is warm enough for the germination of these crops.
		Corn, soybeans, sunflower, sugarbeets, and potatoes must be planted in the spring.

Crops - Hay, Straw, and Grass
		Grass is reset to its harvested stage, to simulate the winter killing off the grass for the winter.
		Grass bales will now need to be fed out or wrapped for silage within 2 days of baling. After 2 days, the grass will rot and disappear.
		Swaths of hay, grass, and straw will begin to reduce in size after (TODO awaiting response), and will eventually disappear after several days.
		Straw and hay must be baled before it can be sold, loose straw and hay cannot be sold as their price is 0. Grass, baled or loose, cannot be sold regardless, as their price is also 0. Wrap the grass bales before selling them.

Crops - Trees
		Trees will now take more time to reach their fully grown state. It now takes the plantable trees 5 game years to be fully grown.
		Trees will now inhibit the growth of other trees if they have been planted too close together. To restart the growth of the tree, you will need thin out the trees.

Crops - Weather Effects
		Rain, hail, and snow will now affect the moisture levels of the crops. The moisture in the crops is above certain point because of bad weather, you will not be able to harvest your crops. Moist summer nights can occur without warning.
		After the rain, your crops will need time to dry out, which is dependent upon the air temperature. Warmer weather means crops will dry out faster than in cooler weather.
		Using a tedder on hay while crops are wet will produce wet grass. Be certain to only use a tedder when the crops are dry enough.
		On a mod map that has been prepared with a snow mask by the modder, hay and straw bales that have been exposed to the rain or snow will begin to rot, unless the bales are stored in a shed with a snowmask. Bad weather will not affect wrapped bales or bales on a map without a snow mask.		
			
Maintenance
		Your tractors and harvesters will now require periodic maintenance in order to keep them operational. The maintenence period is every 30 hours or half a year, which ever comes first. Vechiles that are past due their maintenance may take longer to start.
		You can repair your vehicles either at the vehicle shop or the placeable repair shop. Note that it will be more expensive to repair at the vehicle shop.
		The age of your vehicle is the days since your last repair.
		Only drivable vehicles will require periodic maintenance. Tools and implements will be automatically repaired as needed.
	
Economy
		The loan cap has been changed from 200,000 to 30% of your owned land and placeable building values. The minimum loan cap is 300,000 and the maximum loan cap is 1,000,000.
		Incomes from missions have been reduce. You will now earn roughly 5 times more than a hired worker working on the same field.
		Maintenance of all vehicles (in addition to the periodic maintenance) now includes maintenance and taxes relative to how much it is being used. Clean machines will also reduce maintenance costs. Machines that are not used will also have their maintenance costs reduced.
		Crops prices will now fluctuate with the changes in the seasons in a more realistic manner.
